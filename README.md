# Synergetic-VSCMG
This repo is all about how to create VSCMG 
(Variable Speed Control Moment Gyro) using quaternion-based nonlinear controller and its hardware development.
For Constant Speed CMG using nonlinear control called "Synergetic controller" (kinda like sliding mode control but better power consumption)
, you can check this paper >> https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0206642

Single gimbal CMG was created by using aircraft turn coordinator before. 
I haven't upload the processs yet , but I will do it after this project

This project is the part of research for improve Space Intellegence Center in NKRAFA 
and it is planned to publish in TSME-ICOME 2024 Conference in Thailand.

Hardware development is influenced by @siddharthdeore PhD thesis.
It is so impressive! You guys should check his video on youtube >>>
